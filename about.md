I'm Gagan Malvi, a student of CSE at Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India. I love playing around with Android, both app and platform, and have experience in AOSP and BSP development for both Qualcomm and MediaTek platforms. 

I am the founder and lead developer at [The Styx Project](https://styxproject.tk) [[GitHub](https://github.com/StyxProject)], a custom aftermarket firmware based on AOSP to give the user a complete and clean minimal experience without compromising on smoothness, and stability. 

I'm part of team Paranoid Android.

I'm also a fan of Dilbert and occasionally watch anime.

### Life Advice
Here are a few things I've learned over the years,
> An optimist is simply a pessimist with no job experience.

> There are very few problems that can't be solved through a suitable application of high explosives.
